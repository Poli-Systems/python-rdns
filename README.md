# Welcome to IP Address DNS

This domain redirects all subdomains to a specific IP address if an IP is appended to it.

## Examples

- **1.2.3.4.polisystems.cloud** is an A record for **1.2.3.4**
- **1.2.3.4.reverse.polisystems.cloud** is an A reversed record for **4.3.2.1**
- **anysubdomain.1.2.3.4.polisystems.cloud** is an A reversed record for **1.2.3.4**
- **anysubdomain.1.2.3.4.reverse.polisystems.cloud** is an A reversed record for **4.3.2.1**

You can find the GitHub repository detailing how it works [here](https://github.com/Poli-Systems/python-rdns/tree/master).

Feel free to utilize it for services beyond our corporation.

We took this idea that was originally created by Sam Stephenson at Basecamp for XIP-DNS and now it was remade in Python by Poli Systems GmbH.
